To run:

CD into my-app, then run `yarn` to install dependencies, and then `yarn start` to start the server in localhost and run in browser

Notes:

- I approached this the wrong way starting with setting up redux then focusing on setting up the page/background, rather than starting with the components I actually needed and getting them working first, I also used typescript, which wasn't required, and material UI, for the UI componens, which I haven't used in a long time, so this took me far longer than it should have.
- I have created the spec files but not added tests for most things (and one of my tests is failing, I'm really not sure why), I gave up in favour of functionality as this was supposed to be a 1 hour task but I spent most of a day on it.
- I'm also aware that it doesn't look very pretty but I also sacrificed the aesthetic for the functionality!
- I've added some packages that I didn't end up using such as react router that I didn't end up needing for the scope of this task, but again in the interests of time I've just left them in!
